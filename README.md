# SpinQuest TDC Firmware
Firmware for the upgraded TDC boards for the [SpinQuest](https://spinquest.fnal.gov/) experiment at FNAL. 

## Github branching policy:
We will try to follow [this branching policy](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), wherein `develop` is the default branch and you should branch off that. The `main` branch will contain the _production-ready_ source code. The [Hog](https://hog.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) guidelines should be followed for the build system. 

## Firmware organization:
TBD

## Building:
